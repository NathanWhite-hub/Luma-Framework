//TODOFT4: test highlight effects (glint is fine, actually when it's white it doesn't look as intense, we tried pre-accounting for gamma blends against mid grey, but it doesn't work. The best solution would be to convert it to a compute shader or changing the blend mode (and maybe reading the backbuffer in the shader). For now we went with a 1.5 multiplier)
// This draws some objects highlights directly on the back buffer, after tonemapping but before AA (the output alpha is ignored, it's adding the color anyway).
// These look best linearized by channel at the end, even if it's additive and thus the concept of gamma on additive colors is a bit fuzzy "(linear+linear) != toLinear(gamma+gamma)";
// we could say that originally they would have added in in perceptual space, but there's no way to emulate the SDR gamma space additive blends look without a compute shader (as the back buffer could be linear),
// the best we could do is emulate blending against mid gray (the most likely background color) and pre-apply that offset in the additive color, but it's not worth it.
