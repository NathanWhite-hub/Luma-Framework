  // It's unclear what that means exactly, this is not the same as "CV_ViewProjMatr" so it does have some additional transformation to it, maybe it has the near depth set to 0, but I don't think that is possible.

  // If you have a world space position (relative to the camera), you can reproject it to where it used to be on screen in the last frame, like "float3 screenPosition = mul(CV_ViewProjMatr, float4(worldPosition, 1))".

  // In vanilla CryEngine, it was set "properly" to the previou frame "view/camera projection matrix" ("CV_ViewProjMatr"), except it used the previous frame "view/camera matrix" combined with the current frame "projection matrix",
  // meaning that it wouldn't acknowledge the jitters difference, nor any changes in FOV.
  // Yet somehow, in Prey, motion vectors (which are based on this), manage to be generated correctly, even if it uses a different matrix from vanilla CryEngine (despite the MVs generation code being ~identical).
  // Supposedly they've also replaced and misnamed other variables in shaders so it all works out even if reading the code makes no sense.
  // With Luma hooks, we have kept it at it was in vanilla Prey, but included the previous jitters in it (it's now actually entirely based on the previous projection matrix).
